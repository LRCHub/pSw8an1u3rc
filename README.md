[00:09.12] Imagine me and you, I do
[00:11.72] I think about you day and night, it's only right
[00:16.18] To think about the girl you love
[00:18.68] And hold her tight, so happy together
[00:37.18] 
[00:24.60] If I should call you up, invest a dime
[00:28.00] And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
[00:32.06] Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
[00:35.93] So happy together
[00:44.43] 
[00:41.06] I can't see me loving nobody
[00:44.52] But you for all my life
[00:49.15] When you're with me, baby
[00:51.85] The skies will be blue for all my life
[01:10.85] 
[00:56.98] Me and you and you and me
[00:59.77] No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
[01:03.56] The only one for me is you and you for me
[01:07.67] So happy together
[01:16.17] 
[01:13.06] I can't see me loving nobody
[01:16.73] But you for all my life
[01:20.91] When you're with me, baby
[01:23.55] The skies will be blue for all my life
[01:42.55] 
[01:28.94] Me and you and you and me
[01:31.88] No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
[01:35.75] The only one for me is you and you for me
[01:39.59] So happy together
[01:48.09] 
[02:02.72] Me and you and you and me
[02:05.98] No matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be
[02:09.94] The only one for me is you and you for me
[02:14.28] So happy together
[02:18.25] So happy together
[02:26.75] 
[02:22.33] How is the weather
[02:26.17] So happy together
[02:30.27] We're happy together
[02:34.55] So happy together
[02:43.05] 
[02:38.36] So happy together
[02:42.26] So happy together
[02:46.25] So happy together
[02:50.36] ...
